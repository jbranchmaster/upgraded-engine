## Process

* Prawns Cleaning
   - Take a spoon of crystal salt and turmeric which is enough to wash it twice.
   - Take prawns into a clean vessel and initially clean with plain water.
   - Drain water and then add half of the salt and turmeric. Mix properly so it all prawns are coated evenly.
   - Wash this batch with water and repeat the process.
   - To de-vein, take a tooth-pick or fruit pick and make a small incision on the outer rim of the prawn towards the tail side, to pull out the vein.
   - Now remove the vein with hands slowly.
   - We can also pull of the vein if its visible towards the head end.
