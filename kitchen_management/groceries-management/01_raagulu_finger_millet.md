# Raagulu or Finger Millet

These are like mustard seeeds, but brown in colour. The preparation is time consuming and can take upto a week

# Capacity
- Buy upto 3 kgs each time
- One kg lasts for x months

# Setup Required
- One vessel to hold millets in batches of size 2-3 
- One cloth, which will be used as a filter
- Another cloth that will be used to air-dry the millets inside house
- One basket into which the cloth will be placed
- One bucket into which basket will drain the water

# Cleaning
- Take the millets into a big vessel and initially clean them just as you would clean rice, i.e move the grains inside the vessel with water.
- Throw away the water and repeat this process 3 times. This will remove all the dirt.
- Now take water again into the vessel and soak the millets. Pick a palm full of millets, let some water drain from hands.
- This step can also be done by placing the fingers inside the vessel in one side and shaking it a bit so that millets come and fall into the fingers. This step leaves the stones away.
- After taking out each handful of millets, place them in the basket with cloth. Let the water drain.
- Once all the millets are washed this way, let all the water drain.
- Once all the water has drained this way, spread another dry cloth on the floor and spread the millets and allow them to dry over night.
- Next day, take all this into a big plate and place it under the sun.
  
# Grinding
- Take the dried millets to the mill and have them grinded. The cost is 10 rupees per kg.
