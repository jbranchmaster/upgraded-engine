# Peaanut Toast in OTG

Peanuts toasting in OTG, which otherwise would have been roasted in cast-iron pan

**this method needs improvementsm peanuts could have been roasted a bit more. consider 6min followed by abother 3min * 2x under careful observation**

# Method
- No need to pre-heat the OTG
- Start the OTG and keep the tray with `peanuts` in the middle row (2nd last row)
- Set the funtion to `toast` and reduce the time to `3 minutes`
- After `3 minutes`, remove and see if they are roasted
- If not , again set the timer to `3 minutes` and toast. But stop after `1-2 minutes` and check
- Most nuts would have been cracked and some would appear light brown
- At the end, transfer the plate to the botton most row and close the lid
- Let the `groundnuts` cool down in the OTG itself
