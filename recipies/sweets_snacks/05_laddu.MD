# Laddu

Sweet made with besan

# Core Ingredients
 - 400 gms `besan powder`. Seieve it and keep it aside in a `vessel` which can be also used to make batter
 - 1100 gms `sugar`
 - `sunflower cooking oil` new packet
 - 20-30 `half cashews`
 - 4 `green elachi`. first grind seeds(after removing them from capsules) + little sugar and keep aside. 
 - 2tbsp `baking soda`. add it to the `besan powder after seiving`
 - 2tbsp `ghee`


# Preparation
 - Batter preparation
   - initially add little water to `besan powder` and make it like a hard dough
   - then add more water and make the batter like a consistency of `beaten curd`
   - make the batter consistent and without any lumps and keep aside

 - Oil preparation and frying
   - take oil into a `iron frying pan` upto 75% level of pan and bring it to hot temperature. we used small burner
   - **do not bring it to too hot as it can get overcooked quikcly**
   - using a `small cup` take the batter and pour it on a `jhara/Sieve Strainer` and spread using the bottom of the cup. this will cause batter to fall into the oil
   - let the `boondhi(besan in oil)` fry until it becomes soft, **but not crispy**
   - transfer the `boondhi` to a different dry vessel carefully. avoid taking in too much oil along with it
   - after the first batch, based on your speed, you can adjust the stove flame to bring it to desired temperature
   - for the next batch, **clean the bottom side of the `jhara/Sieve Strainer` so that holes are unclogged**
   - at the end, fry the cashwes until they become light brown and keep them aside

- Syrup Preparation
  - take `sugar` and `200 ml` of water
  - bring it to boil. keep stirring as necessary. we used big vessel(another) and big burner
  - the consistency of syrup should be **like a string**
  - switch off the stove, add `2tbsp ghee` and `elachi powder(with sugar)`, `elachi capsules` and the `boondhi` and mix gently so that `boondhi` is soaked well

- Laddu Making
  - **use a dry hand for this process and avoid water**
  - they can be stored in closed containers after
  - they stay fresh for about **5 days**
