Sweet made with besan

# Core Ingredients
 - 400 gms `besan powder`. Seieve it and keep it aside in a `vessel` which can be also used to make batter
 - 1100 gms `sugar`
 - `sunflower cooking oil` new packet
 - 20-30 `half cashews`
 - 4 `green elachi`
 - 2tbsp `baking soda`. add it to the `besan powder after seiving`
 - 2tbsp `ghee`


# Preparation
 - Batter preparation
   - initially add little water to `besan powder` and make it like a hard dough
   - then add more water and make the batter like a consistency of `beaten curd`
   - make the batter consistent and without any lumps and keep aside

 - Oil preparation and frying
   - take oil into a `iron frying pan` upto 75% level of pan and bring it to hot temperature
   - **do not bring it to too hot as it can get overcooked quikcly**
   - using a `small cup` take the batter and pour it on a `jhara/Sieve Strainer` and spread using the bottom of the cup. this will cause batter to fall into the oil
   - let the `boondhi(besan in oil)` fry until it becomes soft, **but not crispy**
   - transfer the `boondhi` to a different dry vessel carefully. avoid taking in too much oil along with it.
