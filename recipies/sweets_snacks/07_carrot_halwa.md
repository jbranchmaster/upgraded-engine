# Carrot Halwa

Carrot halwa is a sweet made from carrots. We can use both orange carrots or red carrots (Gajar)  

# Core Ingredients
- Carrot - 3 (big ones). Wash it annd grate.  
- Sugar `1.5 glass`
- Milk   `1.5 glasses`. Boil the milk and keep it aside.
- Cashew `8-10`. Cut then into small pieces. 
- Elaichi `4 to 6`
- Ghee `1-2 tbsp`


# Preparaation
- Take cut `cashews` and roast them in a vessel (aluminium) with `ghee`. The cashew colour will change. Do not let them roast more. Now keep cashews aside.
- Transfer  `grated carrot` into the vessel and let it cook for a bit so that raw smell goes away. This step takes upto 5 mins.
- Now pour pre-boiled milk and put the flame low and close it with a lid. This step will take about 25 minutes. At the end, carrot should become soft.
- Cook for buit more so that most milk evaporates.
- Add `sugar` and mix well. Again close the lid. Most of the remaining liquid inside should boil and nothing shall remain. This takes 10 minutes.
- Now add `elaichi`, `ghee` and `cashew` and mix well.
- Switch off the stove and keep the lid open so that it will cool down to room temp.
- After cooling, carrot halwa is ready for consumption.


# Storage
- Carrot halwa can be stored in fridge once it cools down.
