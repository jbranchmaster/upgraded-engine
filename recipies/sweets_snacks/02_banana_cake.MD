# Core Ingredients
 - modified recipe ingredients are in `braces()`
 - 2 very `ripe bananas` together they should weigh `200 grams`
 - 150 grams sugar(`120g`)

 - 2 spoon baking powder
 - 1 spoon baking soda
 - 175 grams sunflower cooking oil(`90grams`). I also used `100grams` of Milky Mist unsalted butter.

## Optional Ingredients
 - 40 grams of nuts `almonds and cashwes` combined
 - 60 grams of dry fuits `dry grapes, cherry, tuti fruti, apricot` combined


# Preparations
- Follow each one in the order
- Use a wide vessel for preparation
- Peel the `banana` and crush them into paste using spoon or a fork. the finer , the better
- Now add `sugar` and mix well so that sugar is dissolved. we can go with 120grams of sugar as well
- Now add `2 whole eggs` and mix them well so that the odour of the egg goes away
- Now add `flour`, `cocoa powder`, `baking powder`, `baking soda` and mix well
- Now add `cooking oil` and mix well. Mix in cut and fold method if possible. Keeps the airi bubles in-tact.
- Pre-heat the oven at 180 degres celsius for 10 minutes
- Bake the cake for ~25mins at 180 degrees celcius
- You will know that the cake is baked when you get the smell or by taking a fruit pick/sharp object and piercing the cake so see if the bottom most part is not moist
