# Dosa Batter
Dosa batter is made from `white rice` and `dosa rice` a.k.a `Boiled Rice ( Uppudu Biyyam )`.

# Preparation
- 1 portion = `110-115 grams` of rice grain mixture, and this gives 6 dosas. Of which `80 grams` boiled rice(**72%**) and `30 grams`(**285**) normal rice
- `Urad dal`. Add about `27 grams` of `urad dal` for i portion of rice grain mixture. Then add a handful of `channa dal` and 2 spoon `fenugreek seeds`
   - if newly bought (< 1 week), results in more batter , so add it `4:1` of i.e for 4 portions 
   - if old (> 1 week), results in lessr batter , so add `5:1` or `6:1` of i.e for 4 portions
