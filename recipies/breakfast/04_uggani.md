# Preparation
 - all cooking is done without closing the lid of the kadai
 - wash the puffed rice by soaking them in water for about 2-3 mintes, gentle rinse so that dust settles at bottom and remove the rice from top. crush the rice gently with hands so that excess water is removed.
 - add `salt` to the puffed rice and keep aside
 - take oil in a kadai
    - add `3 tablespoon oil` and let the oil heat
    - add `mustard seeds` and let it sputter
    - add `jeera seeds` and let it roast just little
    - add `putnalu or `minapa pappu/ whole urad dal` and `channa dal/ senaga pappu` and cook until colour just starts to change. rest of the cooking will ensure its cooked well
    - add `cut onion` and `1 sprig curry leaves` & let them cook until onions become  translucent
    - add `crushed green chilli + curry leaves` and let it cook for a bit
    - add `cut tomatoes` and cook until tomato rawness goes away (we can see the skin separate from few tomato pieces)
    - add `turmeric powder & red chilli powder` and let it cook until the rawness goes away
    - now add `puffed rice` and mix well so that it mixes uniformly with the masala **salt tasting stage**
    - next add `putnalu / roasted channa dal` powder and mix well
