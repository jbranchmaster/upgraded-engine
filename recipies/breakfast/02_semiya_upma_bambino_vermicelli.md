# Semiya Upma or Vermicelli Upma

Made with vermicelli . We use Bambino Vermicelli , which is manufactured by BambinoAgro.

# Core Ingredients
- This serves 4 people
- `1.5 cups` of raw `Bambino Vermicelli`. Each cup measures `300ml`. Can use upto `1.75 cups` for little bigger portion sizes
- `1.2 cups of water to that of vermicelli` for cooking. `1.5` is the max ratio and can remain stagnant or decrease as `Vermicelli` increases
- `2` medium sized carrots. Chop them into small pieces
- `1` cup of `green peas`. Each cup measures `90-100ml`. Soak them in water if they are frozen
- `1` coin sized `ginger piece`. chop them into small pieces
- `2 or 3` medium sized `green chillies` . chop them into small pieces
- `few` mustard seeds
- `1 spoon` of `urad dal`
- `1 spoon` of `channa dal`
-  1 sprig `curry leaves`

# Pre Preparation For Busy People
Vermicelli can be roasted the night before and stored in room temperature. ensure it cools down before closing with a lid.

# Preparation

 ## Roasting the Vermicelli
  - Add `2 to 3` spoons of `ghee` into a vessel and Vermicelli
  - Actively roast the Vermicelli untill it turns brown
  - Keep mixing it well so that the bottom portion is not over-roasted
  - Keep it aside (take it into another plate)
  - **time saver tip - heat water while you are cutting the vegetables so that it saves around 5-8 minutes**

 ## Rest of the preparation

 - Add `1 to 2` spoons of oil into the vessel used to roast Vermicelli. Since we already roasted Vermicelli, this step can take little lesser oil.
    - add `mustard seeds` and let them pop
    - add `urad dal` and `channa dal` , roast a bit. no need to roast them until they change colour because the following steps will continue to cook them.
    - add `ginger` and roast a bit
    - add chopped `green chilles`
    - add `curry leaves`
    - add `carrot` and roast a bit
    - add `green peas` (without water) and cook a bit
    - add `water` , `salt` and switch to medium flame and close the vessel with a lid. 
    - let the contents come to a `boiling state`. takes about `~12 minutes`
    - now add the `roasted Vermicelli` and cook on `medium to high flame` with closed lid . do not cook on low flame at all.
    - in `10-15 minutes`, the dish would have cooked. you can confirm this by seeing the absense of water. if needed , at an interval of `5 to 8 minutes` mix contents once and continue cooking with closed lid.
    - once cooking is done swith off the stove and keep the lid closed.
