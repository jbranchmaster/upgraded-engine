# Kadhi

Eaten with plain rice or jeera rice. Some also like to have it with roti.

# Core Ingredients
 - Serves `3` light eaters
 - 3 spoons `curd`. Curd should be room temperature before cooking.
 - 1.5 spoons `besan/gram flour/ channa dal flour`. ratio of `curd:besan` is approximately upto a max of 1:0.5 **if at all you need to add more besan and curd, mix them together and then add it**
 - I add around 100 grams curd and 50 grams besan for 3 people.
 - 1 to 1.5  tbsp `red chilli powder`
 - 1 tea spoon `turmeric`
 - `salt` to taste. this dish takes in little more salt than usual.
 - 1 small `onion`. chop them into small pieces. small pieces are better.
 - 2 `green chillies`. chop them into small pieces
 - few `mustard seeds`
 - 1 tea spoon `jeera seeds`
 - 1 tea spoon `hing/asafoetida`
 - 1 `red chilli`

# Preparation
- Curd slurry
  - take `curd` into a bowl and mix well so that there are no lumps
  - add `besan` and mix well so that there are no lumps
  - add `salt, turmeric powder and red chilli powder` and mix well so that there are no lumps
  - add `water`. 100-150ml should be enough per 1 light eater. I add around 300-350ml for 3 people and 400ml for 4 people.
  - if the curd is cold, let this slurry cool down before boiling
- Boiling curd slurry
  - take  2 or 3 tbsp `oil` into a vessel and heat it
  - add `mustard` seeds and let it sputter
  - add `jeers` seeds and let it sputter
  - add `hing` and cook for a bit
