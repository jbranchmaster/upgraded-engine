 - Now add `chopped veggies`, `grounded masala`,  `salt and red chilli powder` and cook for ~15 minutes with open lid
 - Transfer this vessel to another burner and proceed with seasoning in a new vessel **no need for onions to become dark brown, but they should cook well**
 - Transfer the contents of the veggies vessel into the seasoning vessel and cook for 5mins with open lid.
 - Can add more water if needed at this stage. If adding water, add it to the veggies vessel so that any leftover masala is not wasted and transfer that water into the seasoning vessel
