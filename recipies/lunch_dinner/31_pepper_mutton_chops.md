# Pepper Mutton Chops

Goes well with jeera rice or bagara rice. The spiciness should come from `pepper` and not `red chillies` 

# Core Ingredients
This recipe is for 1 kg mutton. It comes to 8 chop pieces. I used cook and serve cooker for roasting masala and also curry prep.
- cooking oil as needed(we use groundnut oil). 
- Masala items. Roast them in `2-3 spoon` cooking oil.
   - `2` cloves
   - `2` green elachi
   - `1 inch` cinnamom  **above 3 can be roasted in 1st batch. next batch can add below ingredients**
   - `3 spoon` pepper
   - `8-12` spicy red chillies
   - `3-4 spoon` dhanya seeds **this ends batch of masala. remove all above ingredients and let them cool**
- `2 medium` sized onions. Chop them and roast them after the above step. Keep it aside for cooling.
- `6` garlic pods
- `3-4 inch` ginger
- `1 spoon` turmeric
- `salt` to taste
- `2 sprig` curry leaves
- `3 spoon` curd

# Preparation
- Prepare the masala paste
  - Initially grind the roasted masala ingredients into fine powder
  - Next add the roasted onions and grind them together in fine paste
- Take `cooking oil` into a pan and add `ginger-garlic` paste. Cook until raw smell goes away
- Add `masala paste` and cook for sometime.
- Next add `mutton chops` and `tuemeric powder` and mix well.
- Cook with closed lid for `5-10` minutes so that water from the mutton comes out
- Once all the water comes out, add `2 spoons salt` and `curd` and `150ml` water. No need to add more water.
- Transfer to cooker and cook on `3` medium whistles. To speed up, we can being the contents to boil before closing the cooker.
- Let the contents cool and remove the cooker cover. We may notice more oil on the top, which is from the mutton fat.
- If you want it served as gravy, stop here.
- If you want it little dry, separate the `gravy` and `chops`. Add `curry leaves` and thicken the gravy into a paste like form.
- Add the `chops` back and cook until the chops become darkish red colour.
