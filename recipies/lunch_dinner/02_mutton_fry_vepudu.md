# Mutton Fry
Eaten as a side with rice and dal. Cooked with cast iron kadai.

# Core Ingredients
- Serves `4` people for `500g mutton`. the ingredients are for `500gm` mutton
- For marination ; original recipe calls for overnight marination. we can marinate for 2 hours if time is constraint
   - washed `500 grams mutton`
   -  `2 tbsp` of  `red chilli powder`
   -  `1 tbsp` of `ginger and garlic` paste
   -  `salt` to taste
   -  `1tbsp` of `turmeric`
   -  `2tbsp` of `dhanya powder` (corriander powder)
   -  `3tbsp` of `vegetable oil`. we used `groundnut oil`
   -  mix all and refrigerate the marinate
 - For cooking on pressure cooker
   - same type `vegetable oil` used for marination. `2 tbsp` oil. heat it first. since we already add oil in marination and also mutton may have fat , we dont need so much oil.
   - add `marinated` mutton
   - `300ml` water. this is a ball park estimate. we will again roast the mutton , so adding too much in this step increases the cooking time in next steps.
   - `4 to 5 max` whistles on medium flame should be enough. 
   - **as a modification, after adding the marinated mutton , we can cook until water from mutton comes out, and then follow the next steps from adding water**
 - For frying (used cast-iron kadai) ; we can use non-stick also
    - `2 sprigs` of `curry leaves`
    - `3 green chilli` . cut them into two halves and then slit them
    - `4` red chilli . tear them into `3 or 4` pieces
    - `1tbsp` of `ginger and garlic` paste
    - `1 sprig` of `curry leaves` and `2 sprig` `corriander leaves` for garnishing
    - `garam masala`
   
# Preparation
 - start with marination
 - after marination , add mutton to cooker or **read the modification step**
 - let the cooker cool down and proceed with frying
 - for frying
    - take `oil` into `kadai` and heat it
    - add `curry` leaves and let them cook
    - add `green chilles` and `red chilles` and let them cook
    - add `ginger garlic` paste and cook until the raw smell goes off. this will sputter and can also stick to pan. 
    - now add the `mutton` from cooker , along with the water
    - cook on `medium` flame with frequent stirring and without lid
    - it takes `15 to 20` mins for the `water` to evaporate
    - when we can see the `oil` , add `1tbsp` of `garam masala` and fry till masala cooks
    - add `1 sprig` of `curry leaves` and `2 sprig` `corriander leaves` for garnishing and switch off the stove
