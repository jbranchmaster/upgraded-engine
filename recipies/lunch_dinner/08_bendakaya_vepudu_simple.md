# Bendakaya Vepudu Simple
Eaten along with dal and rice.

# Core Ingredients
- Serves `4` people for a single meal
- `250g Ladyfinger`. wash them , dry them and cut them into 1/2 inch pieces. ensure all pieces are equally cut so that they cook consistently. do not cut them into large pieces at all.
- Salt, Red Chilli powder and saagu powder(optional)

# Preparation
- Take `oil` into a pan and heat it a bit. Takes `4-5 tbsp`
- Add `cut Ladyfinger` pieces into the pan and mix them so that they all cover well in oil
- Cover the pan with a lid and let it cook on low flame for `12-15 minutes`
- You will know its cooked well when we see the stickiness go away(we can notice them as a thread between pieces when we mix them in the pan) and the pieces turn little dark brown
- Once this stage is reached, remove the lid
- Sprinkle `salt + red chilli powder` mix and optionally saagu powder. Optionally we can add few curry leaves also
- Cook it for some more time so that the chilli powder sticks to the ladyfinger and rawness taste goes away
- Switch off the stove

# Serving
- Serve it as a side with dal and rice
