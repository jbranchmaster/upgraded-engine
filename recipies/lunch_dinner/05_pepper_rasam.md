# Preparation
 - Core Rasam
   - take a bowl and add `water` (little less than the needed rasam quantity)
   - add `salt` and `turmeric powder`
   - `cut tomatoes into two halves` and add into the bowl
   - cook them for a while . after sometime , turn the tomatoes so that they cook evenly
   - switch off the stove and add `tamrind`
   - let it cool down
   - then take the `tomatoes` into another bowl, remove the skin(transfer skin into the 1st bowl) and crush them well. any whitish pulp from the tomato can be discarded
   - now crush the tamarind and the tomato skin in the first bowl. discard the skin and tamrind pulp
   - now filter the contents of the first bowl into the 2nd bowl
   - at this stage , we can taste for salt and also rasam quantity and add more if needed
   - `crush pepper & garlic` in mortar and pestle and add to 2nd bowl
   - add `cut corriander leaves` and `curry leaves`
   - now boil the `2nd bowl` on low flame untill the contents come to boil and we can smell pepper
   - keep 2nd bowl aside  
- Seasoning
  -  `take little ghee` into a bowl and heat it . as the `ghee` will be less , tilt the bowl so that ghee comes to a corner
  -  add `mustard seeds and red chilli` and let the mustard seeds sputter
  -  now quickly transfer the contents of `2nd bowl` from the previous step and close the lid
