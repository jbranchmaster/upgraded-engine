# Bitter Gourd or Kakarakaya Fry
Eaten as a curry with rice and dal. This method does not de-seed , so the fry it can taste extra bitter.

# Core Ingredients
 - Serves `3` people for a single meal
 - `3` medium bitter gourd. wash them with water , you can also scrub the exterior gently with hands so that the exterior projects go off. next cut the ends & cut them into slices. If they are reddish inside , they are ripening , but can be still eaten.
 - masala prep using mixer (can be made while the bitter gourd is cooking)
    - take `1 or 2` spoons of jeera and grind well
    - add `1 spoon red chilli powder` and grind well
    - add `1 spoon salt` and grind until `jeera` seeds are not be seen. half of the salt can be added in the bitter groud too
      
# Preparation
 - Add  `3 to 4` spoons oil to a pan and add the cut `bitter gourd slices`. This dish uses more oil.
 - Mix them well so that they are cooked for a bit. You will notice that the `white centre` starts to fade. no need for all the slices to fade this way
 - Add little water to the pan and close it with a lid a cook on low flame
 - You will know when its cooked when you can `split the slices` into half using the spatula
 - When its at this stage , remove the lid and cook until the `water and oil evaporates`. This and the next step can be done at a slightly higher flame
 - Cook for some more time until the `edges turn slightly` brown . The smaller slices will probably break into smaller pieces and turn brown quicker
 - After the slices have turned brown , sprinkle the masala and cook for `2 to 3 minutes` so that it mixes well and the raw masala smell goes away
 - **Sprinking the masala across evenly makes it easier for curry to get even taste**
