# Core Ingredients
- Serves `4` people for a single meal
- `250g ladies finger`. wash them , dry them and cut them into 1/2 inch pieces. do not cut them into large pieces at all.
- `1-2 inches` of `tamarid` soak them in water. do not drown them
- `4 peeled garlic`. no need to chop them
- `2 small sized onions`. cut them into medium sized cubes
- `1 medium sized tomato`. cut them into medium pieces
- `3 green chilles` . cut into vertical 2 half pieces
- `salt` and `turmeric powder` for taste
- seasoning
   - `1 spoon mustard seeds`
   - `1 sprig curry leaves`
   - `2 red chillies`
 
# Preparation
- take `3 to 4` tbs spoon oil into a pan or vessel and heat it
- add `garlic` and wait for slight colour change
- add `onion` and cook for a bit. let onions become little translucent and not more cooked
- add `lady's finger` and cook on medium flame until we  see stickiness between cut pieces go away
- add `tomato` and cook for a bit such that rawness of tomato should go away. if you see skin peeling off few tomato pieces its a sign it has cooked. **this step takes `10-15 minutes`**
- add `turmeric and salt`. since we add tamarid and tomato , this dish may need little more salt
- if you see that the contents are sticking to the bottom of pan , add little more oil or add very little water 
- now open the lid and add `tamarind` and `green chillies` and cook for `2-3 minutes`. the `tamarind` can be added along with its soaked water. to make it easier while eating , crush the pulp and remove the hard pulp before adding.
- now add `250-300ml` water and close the lid and cook for `10-12 minutes` on low flame **adjust water if you added more water with tamrind juice**
- cook until most of the water evaporates. it should neither look like gravy(watery extreme) nor look like fry (no water extreme). it should be in a state where if you turn the contents around you will notice water
- now stake it off stove and smash the contents - mainly focus smashing `lady's finger` . **salt tasting stage**
- now proceed with seasoning
- seasoning `pan #2`
    - heat `oil` in a pan
    - add `mustard seeds` and let it sputter
    - add `red chilli` and `curry leaves`
    - add the contents into the cooked and smashed `lady's finger`
