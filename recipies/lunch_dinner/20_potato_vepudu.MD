# Potato Vepudu
Eaten along with plain white rice and dal


# Core Ingredients
 - Serves 3 light eaters
 - 4-5 medium sized `potatoes`. Peel and then cut them into 2 inch pieces and keep them in water for about 10-15 mins.
 - 1.5 to 2 (max) teaspoon oil for each potato
 - 1/2 sprig `curry leaves`
 - `salt` and `red chilli` powder (mix them and keep aside)

# Preparation 
 - Take `oil` into a pan and heat it
 - Once the oil heats up , add `cut potatoes` and toss them so that they are covered in oil
 - Close the pan with a lid and cook for about 5-8 minutes in low flame
 - You will know its cooked when the potatoes change colour to light brown. If colour hasnt changed, allow them to cook for upto ~ `6 minutes` 
 - At that point, toss them again so that they cook evenly
 - When `70%` of them have turned brown, cook on `medium flame` with open lid. If there's too much excess oil , we can remove it at this stage
 - As `80-90%` are cooked, sprinkle the `salt and red chilli` powder and also add the `curry leaves`
 - Continue cooking with open lid for `~4-5 minutes` for red chilli raw flavour to go away
 - Switch off the stove
