 - 2 tbsp `vangibath powder` for new powder , else 3 tbsp or more if the powder is older.
 - 1 teaspoon `turmeric powder`
 - 1 teaspoon `salt`
 - 1 teaspoon `mustard seeds`
 - 1 `red chilli`, split this into two pieces
 - 1 tea spoon `urad dal` and `chenna dal`
 - 1 spring `curry leaves`
 -  `sunflower` cooking oil

# Preparation
 - Initially prepare white rice for `3` light eaters. Once rice cools down, we cam mix well so that no lumps are formed. also add salt to taste.
 - Take cooking 5 to 6 tea spoons oil into a cooking vessel and bring it to boil
 - Add `mustard seeds` and let them sputter
 - Next add  `channa dal and urad dal` and cook them a bit
 - Next add the split `red chilli` and cook until `channa dal and urad dal` change colour and become little dark **noticed that it will change colour in the subsequent steps too, so no need for complete colour change**
 - Next add `curry leaves`, `brinjal pieces` and `turmeric and salt`
 - Close the vessel with a lid and cook on smmall flame until the brinjal pieces begin to cook. they will become translucent and reduce in size a bit **takes 10mins**
 - Now remove the lid and cook on high flame so that the `brinjal` becomes fried - reduce further in size and turn into `dark brownish`
 - Now inside the vessel, move existing `brinjal + other contents` to one side and add the cut `tomatoes` to the other half
 - Cover the `tomato` with the brinjal and cook with closed lid on small flame until tomatoes cook. you will know its cooked when the skin of the tomato separates off its flesh
 - Now remove the lid and add `vangibath powder`, mix well. cook until we get the `vangibath aroma` and oil starts to float. this takes about max of 5 minutes
 - Now switch off the stove and proceed with mixing masala with rice. no need to wait for masala to cool down
 - Add this masala to white rice previously prepared. mix well so that masala mixes with rice. taste and add salt if needed.
