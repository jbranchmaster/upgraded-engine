  # Preparation
  - Grind the masala using mixer with all ingredients except kheema. The masala should not be coarse(rough)
  - Add the masala to the kheema vessel and mix them well
  - Take a big jar and add the mixed kheema and masala and gring it for about ~3-5 seconds so that it becomes a unifirm mixture. Do not make it fine paste.
  - Now made gooseberry sized balls and keep them on a wide plate. They wont stick together, so do not worry
  - Take `cooking oil` into a pan and heat it
  - Place the kheema balls in the pan. Do this step little quickly as the balls can split
  - Now add water so that the kheema balls are at 1/2 submerged in water
  - Cook with closed lid on medium flame for about 15-20 mins. Do not mix then at this point
  - After 15-20 mins open the lid and turn the balls around and cook for 10-15 mins with closed lid
  - By this time most water should have evaporated. We can crack the ball and taste a bit for **salt and spicinesss**
  - If more salt/chilli is needed , we can add it to the water in the pan and add little more water and cook until the water evaporates a
  - Do the tasing test and also cooked test
     - If not cooked, add water and cook for 10-15mins with closed lid
     - If cooked and not spicy, cook until water evaporates and add `1 spoon pepper` along with `ghee` and roast the kheema balls for 2-3 minutes
     - If cooked and its enough spicy,just roast the `kheema balls` in `ghee` for about 2-3 minutes
